---

## 🎯 System Architecture

### **1. Data Collection (Scrapers)**

**Transaction Sources (Every 30 minutes):**
- CapWages.com/moves (structured data - 62 transactions)
- TSN.ca (trade tracker + free agency)
- Sportsnet.ca
- NHL.com
- DailyFaceoff
- ESPN.com/nhl/injuries (injury reports)
- All 32 team websites

**News Article Sources (Every 6 hours):**
- NHL.com main site (10 articles)
- Sportsnet.ca (Canadian perspective)
- DailyFaceoff (analytics focus)
- All 32 team websites (team-specific content)

**Game Data (Daily at 1 AM):**
- NHL API scoreboard (yesterday's games with scores, performers, images)

---

### **2. Intelligent Processing**

**Content Filtering:**
- ✅ Removes articles with <150 chars (headlines only)
- ✅ Separates transactions from news articles
- ✅ Validates LLM responses (rejects apologies/refusals)
- ✅ Rejects generic titles ("General Update", etc.)

**Article Clustering:**
- Groups related articles by semantic similarity
- Detects duplicate coverage across sources
- Identifies: players mentioned, teams involved, keywords

**AI Synthesis (Claude Sonnet 4.5):**
- **Single-source articles**: LLM rewrites in HeartBeat voice (unique content)
- **Multi-source articles**: LLM synthesizes multiple sources (cross-validated)
- **All content 100% unique** to avoid copyright issues
- **Dynamic source citations** - only cites actual sources used

**Cross-Validation:**
- Transactions: Requires 2+ sources for major moves (trades, signings)
- Routine moves: CapWages alone is trusted (IR, recalls, loans)
- Date extraction: Parses actual event dates from source text

---

### **3. Data Storage (DuckDB)**

**Tables:**
- `transactions` (62 records) - with actual event dates
- `team_news` (8 articles) - AI-synthesized with metadata
- `game_summaries` (4 games) - with images
- `daily_articles` - league-wide digest
- `player_updates` - performance summaries

**Metadata Stored:**
- Source names (nhl, sportsnet, dailyfaceoff, etc.)
- Source count (1 = single, 2+ = multi-source)
- Source URLs (for citations)
- Images from articles
