## EXPECTED TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE (Text-Only Responses)
```
Query: "Where do I rank among wingers with similar ice time?"
Response: "Comparative analysis places you in the 76th percentile among similar players,
with particular strength in defensive reliability..."
Generic response, no actual data
```

### AFTER (HeartBeat Engine with Qwen3-Next-80B Thinking + LangGraph)
```
Query: "Where do I rank among wingers with similar ice time?"

Qwen3-Next-80B Thinking Process:
1. Decomposes query → needs player ice time + winger comparisons + percentile calculations
2. Plans tool chain → pinecone.search (context) → parquet.filter (data) → stats.compute (metrics)
3. Executes with function calling → structured JSON tool arguments, no hallucination
4. Synthesizes evidence-based response

Response: "Based on your 18.3 minutes average ice time, you rank in the 76th percentile
among NHL wingers (data from 247 qualifying players). Your 2.1 goals per 60 minutes
places you 23rd among this group, while your 52.3% Corsi percentage ranks 156th.
Recent trend analysis shows 12% improvement in high-danger chances over your last 10 games,
with particularly strong performance in defensive zone exits (68.5% success rate,
84th percentile)."
Specific metrics, percentiles, trends, evidence-based analysis
```

### Technical Architecture Achievement
**Qwen3-Next-80B Thinking on Vertex AI:**
- **Reasoning-First Design**: Multi-step planning and decomposition for complex hockey queries
- **Autonomous Tool Orchestration**: Plans optimal tool chains (Pinecone → Parquet → Analytics → Visualization)
- **Function Calling**: Strict JSON schemas prevent hallucination in tool arguments
- **MoE Efficiency**: Only subset of 80B parameters activate per token, controlling costs
- **Vision Delegation**: Selectively invokes Qwen3-VL only when visual analysis needed
- **Cloud Convenience**: Managed serving via Google Cloud Model Garden with quota controls
