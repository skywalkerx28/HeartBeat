## ðŸ“Š Use Cases for GMs & Analysts

### Contract Negotiations
**Question**: "Is this player still producing at peak levels?"
```
Action: Compare last 3 seasons
Result: 
- 2023-24: 45 points (trending up)
- 2022-23: 38 points (steady)
- 2021-22: 42 points (dip mid-season)
Decision: Player is trending positive, worth extension
```

### Trade Analysis
**Question**: "How does this player's career arc compare to our target?"
```
Action: Compare player's breakout season vs target's same age season
Result:
- Player A (Age 24): 28 goals through 50 games
- Player B (Age 24): 22 goals through 50 games
Decision: Player A has higher ceiling
```

### Draft Evaluation
**Question**: "Is this rookie on track compared to similar prospects?"
```
Action: Compare rookie season vs comparable player's first year
Result:
- Rookie: 15 points through 20 games (0.75 PPG)
- Comparable: 18 points through 20 games (0.90 PPG)
Decision: Rookie slightly behind but within range
```

### Injury Recovery Assessment
**Question**: "Has player returned to pre-injury production levels?"
```
Action: Compare pre-injury season vs post-injury season
Result:
- 2021-22 (pre-injury): Sharp upward trend to 60 points
- 2023-24 (post-injury): Flat trend around 40 points
Decision: Production has not fully recovered
```

### Line Combination Optimization
**Question**: "Which season had the best PP production rate?"
```
Action: Compare PP Points across 4 seasons
Result:
- 2022-23: Steady climb to 25 PPP (best trend)
- 2021-22: Slower start, finished at 18 PPP
- 2020-21: Inconsistent, 15 PPP
Decision: Use 2022-23 line combinations as template
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

### Bloomberg Terminal Inspiration
- **Information density**: Maximum data, minimal chrome
- **Professional color palette**: Distinct but not garish
- **Subtle animations**: Smooth, not distracting
- **Clean typography**: Military display font for data clarity
- **Dark theme**: Easy on the eyes for long analysis sessions

### Wall Street Analyst Standards
- **Multi-asset comparison**: Like comparing multiple stocks
- **Normalized timescales**: All data on same X-axis range
- **Color coding**: Each asset (season) gets unique identifier
- **Quick switching**: Dropdown menus, not endless buttons

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

```
Frontend Request Flow:
1. User selects seasons [2023-24, 2022-23, 2021-22]
2. Component checks cache for each season
3. Missing seasons fetched from API:
   GET /api/nhl/player/8475848/cumulative/20232024/regular
   GET /api/nhl/player/8475848/cumulative/20222023/regular
   GET /api/nhl/player/8475848/cumulative/20212022/regular
4. Data stored in Map<season, CumulativeSeasonData>
5. Chart component merges data based on mode:
   - Single: Use actual dates
   - Comparison: Normalize to game numbers
6. Recharts renders multi-line overlay
7. Stats grid calculates totals per season
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedSeasons, setSelectedSeasons] = useState<number[]>([])
const [comparisonMode, setComparisonMode] = useState(false)
const [cumulativeDataMap, setCumulativeDataMap] = useState<Map<number, CumulativeSeasonData>>(new Map())
```

### Data Normalization for Comparison
```typescript
// Multi-season overlay: normalize to game number (1-82)
const maxGames = 82
const normalized: any[] = []

for (let gameNum = 1; gameNum <= maxGames; gameNum++) {
  const point: any = { gameNumber: gameNum }
  
  selectedSeasons.forEach((season) => {
    const data = cumulativeDataMap.get(season)
    if (data && data.games[gameNum - 1]) {
      const game = data.games[gameNum - 1]
      point[`season_${season}`] = game[selectedMetric] || 0
    }
  })
  
  normalized.push(point)
}
```

### Multi-Line Rendering
```typescript
{comparisonMode && selectedSeasons.map((season, idx) => (
  <Line
    key={season}
    type="monotone"
    dataKey={`season_${season}`}
    stroke={SEASON_COLORS[idx % SEASON_COLORS.length]}
    strokeWidth={2}
    dot={false}
    activeDot={{ r: 4 }}
  />
))}
```
