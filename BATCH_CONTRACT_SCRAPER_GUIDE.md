### Basic Commands

```bash
# Scrape ALL 769 NHL players (takes ~25-30 minutes)
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py

# Test with first 10 players
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --max 10

# Resume from player 100 (if interrupted)
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --start 100

# Scrape specific range (players 50-100)
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --start 50 --max 50

# Fast mode (1 second delay between requests)
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --delay 1.0

# Custom output directory
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --output-dir data/custom_contracts
```

### Command Line Options

- `--output-dir, -o`: Output directory (default: `data/contracts`)
- `--delay, -d`: Delay between requests in seconds (default: 2.0)
- `--start, -s`: Start from player index (default: 0)
- `--max, -m`: Maximum players to process (default: all 769)
- `--progress-file, -p`: Progress tracking file (default: `data/contracts/batch_progress.json`)

## 📊 Output Files

### Per Player (3 files each)
1. **Contracts**: `lastname_playerid_contracts_timestamp.csv`
2. **Contract Details**: `lastname_playerid_contract_details_timestamp.csv`
3. **Summary**: `lastname_playerid_summary_timestamp.csv`

### Batch Files
1. **Progress Tracking**: `batch_progress.json` (updated every 10 players)
2. **Batch Summary**: `batch_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` (final report)
3. **Log File**: `batch_scrape.log` (detailed logging)

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

The scraper automatically saves progress every 10 players to `batch_progress.json`:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2025-10-16T16:20:18",
  "total_players": 769,
  "processed": 250,
  "succeeded": 245,
  "failed": 5,
  "current_index": 250,
  "successes": [...],
  "failures": [...]
}
```

**Resume After Interruption**:
```bash
# If stopped at player 250, resume with:
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --start 250
```

---

## 🎯 URL Construction

CapWages player URLs are constructed automatically:

**Format**: `https://capwages.com/players/{firstname}-{lastname}`

**Examples**:
- Sidney Crosby → `https://capwages.com/players/sidney-crosby`
- Connor McDavid → `https://capwages.com/players/connor-mcdavid`
- J.T. Miller → `https://capwages.com/players/jt-miller`
- K'Andre Miller → `https://capwages.com/players/kandre-miller`

**Name Normalization**:
- Periods and apostrophes removed (`J.T.` → `jt`, `K'Andre` → `kandre`)
- Spaces converted to hyphens
- Lowercase

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

With default settings (2 second delay):
- **10 players**: ~20 seconds
- **50 players**: ~2 minutes
- **100 players**: ~3-4 minutes
- **All 769 players**: ~25-30 minutes

With fast mode (1 second delay):
- **All 769 players**: ~13-15 minutes

---

## 💾 Database Storage

All scraped contracts are stored in `data/heartbeat_news.duckdb`:

**Tables**:
- `player_contracts`: Main contracts with NHL player_id
- `contract_details`: Year-by-year financial breakdown

**Query Examples**:
```sql
-- Get all contracts for a team
SELECT * FROM player_contracts WHERE team_code = 'PIT';

-- Get all entry-level contracts
SELECT * FROM player_contracts WHERE contract_type LIKE '%Entry-Level%';

-- Get players with NMC clauses
SELECT DISTINCT pc.player_name, pc.player_id 
FROM player_contracts pc
JOIN contract_details cd ON pc.id = cd.contract_id
WHERE cd.clause = 'NMC';
```

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The scraper includes robust error handling:

1. **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Missing Pages**: Logged as failed, continues to next player
3. **Parsing Errors**: Captured and logged, doesn't stop batch
4. **Progress Saved**: Every 10 players, no data loss on interruption

**Common Failures**:
- Player not found on CapWages (no profile exists)
- Name mismatch (spelling differences)
- Network timeouts

All failures are logged to `batch_scrape.log` and `batch_summary.csv`

## 📋 Batch Summary Report

After completion, a comprehensive CSV report is generated:

## 🏃 Running the Full Batch

### Recommended Approach

```bash
# 1. Test with small sample first
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py --max 10

# 2. Run full batch (can be interrupted and resumed)
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py

# 3. Monitor progress in real-time
tail -f data/contracts/batch_scrape.log

# 4. Check results
cat data/contracts/batch_progress.json | python -m json.tool
```

### Running in Background

```bash
# Run in background with nohup
nohup python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py > batch_scrape_output.txt 2>&1 &

# Check progress
tail -f batch_scrape_output.txt

# Or use screen/tmux for better control
screen -S contract_scraper
python scripts/batch_scrape_contracts.py
# Detach with Ctrl+A, D
# Reattach with: screen -r contract_scraper
```
