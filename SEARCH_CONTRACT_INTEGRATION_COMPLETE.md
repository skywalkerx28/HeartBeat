# Search & Contract Integration - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated historical roster search and contract CSV data into the HeartBeat application. The system now allows searching through all players in the historical roster and displays their complete contract history from CapWages CSV files.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Search System Updates

#### Backend (`backend/api/routes/search.py`)
- **Updated roster data source**: Changed from `unified_roster_20252026.json` to `unified_roster_historical.json`
- **Fixed data structure compatibility**: Handles both `currentTeam`/`currentTeamName` (historical) and `team`/`teamName` (current) formats
- **Improved relevance scoring algorithm**:
  - Matches on both first and last names
  - Exact matches score highest (100.0)
  - First name starts: 92.0
  - Last name starts: 93.0 (slightly prefer last name)
  - Veteran player boost based on player ID (lower ID = more established)
  - Smart partial matching for compound names

#### Frontend (`frontend/components/analytics/AnalyticsNavigation.tsx`)
- **Increased search limit**: From 10 to 20 results for better coverage
- **Added API base URL handling**: Uses environment variable with localhost fallback
- **Improved error logging**: Better debugging for failed searches

#### Search Capabilities
- ✅ Search by **full name** (e.g., "Connor McDavid")
- ✅ Search by **first name** (e.g., "Connor" finds all Connors)
- ✅ Search by **last name** (e.g., "Matthews" finds Auston Matthews)
- ✅ Search by **partial name** (e.g., "matthew" finds both Matthew* and *Matthews)
- ✅ Search by **team code** (e.g., "TOR")
- ✅ Search by **team name** (e.g., "Toronto")

### 2. Contract Data Integration

#### New API Endpoint (`backend/api/routes/market.py`)
Created `/api/v1/market/contracts/csv/{player_id}` endpoint:

**Features:**
- Reads contract CSV summary files from `/data/contracts/`
- Parses player metadata, contracts, and year-by-year details
- **Transforms CSV data to `PlayerContract` format** for frontend compatibility
- Handles currency parsing ($13,250,000 → 13250000.0)
- Handles percentage parsing (14.5% → 14.5)
- Calculates years remaining based on current season
- Detects contract clauses (NTC, NMC)

**Data Structure Transformation:**
```python
CSV Format (Raw):
{
  "player_name": "Auston#34 Matthews",
  "contracts_list": [...],
  "contract_details_list": [...]
}

Transformed to PlayerContract:
{
  "nhl_player_id": 8479318,
  "cap_hit": 13250000.0,
  "cap_hit_percentage": 14.5,
  "years_remaining": 4,
  "contract_type": "Standard Contract (Extension)",
  "no_trade_clause": false,
  "no_movement_clause": true,
  "contract_status": "Active",
  "contracts": [...],  // Preserved for advanced display
  "contract_details": [...]
}
```

#### Frontend Updates (`frontend/lib/marketApi.ts`)
Modified `getPlayerContract()` function:
- **Try CSV endpoint first** (historical CapWages data)
- **Fallback to market analytics** if CSV not found
- Graceful degradation for players without contract data

## Data Pipeline

### Contract Data Flow
```
1. CapWages Scraper (scripts/scrape_missing_contracts.py)
   ↓
2. CSV Summary Files (data/contracts/*_summary_*.csv)
   ↓
3. API Endpoint (/api/v1/market/contracts/csv/{player_id})
   ↓
4. Data Transformation (CSV → PlayerContract format)
   ↓
5. Frontend Display (PlayerContractSection component)
```

### Search Data Flow
```
1. Historical Roster (data/processed/rosters/unified_roster_historical.json)
   ↓
2. Search API (/search?q=...&limit=20)
   ↓
3. Relevance Scoring & Ranking
   ↓
4. Frontend Search Results (AnalyticsNavigation component)
   ↓
5. Player Profile Navigation
```

## Testing

### Contract CSV Endpoint Test
```bash
python3 scripts/test_contract_csv_endpoint.py
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Auston Matthews (8479318) - Success
- ✅ Connor McDavid (8478402) - Success

- ✅ 404 handling for non-existent players

### Search Endpoint Tests
```bash
# Search by first name
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=connor&limit=20"
# Returns: Connor McDavid, Connor Bedard, etc.

# Search by last name
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=matthews&limit=10"
# Returns: Auston Matthews

# Search by partial name
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=matthew&limit=15"
# Returns: Matthew Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, etc.
```

## File Organization

### Contract Files
```
data/contracts/
  ├── matthews_8479318_summary_20251017_123456.csv
  ├── mcdavid_8478402_summary_20251017_123457.csv
  └── ... (1,772 total files)
```

**Naming Convention**: `{lastname}_{playerid}_summary_{timestamp}.csv`

### Key Implementation Files

## Known Limitations

1. **Contract Data Coverage**: ~90% of players have contract data
   - Some older/inactive players not on CapWages
   - Minor league players may be missing

2. **Years Remaining Calculation**: Currently static (2024 base year)
   - TODO: Make dynamic based on current date

3. **Player Age**: Not available in CSV files
   - Field exists but set to 0

---

## Future Enhancements

### Search
- [ ] Add position filtering (e.g., show only centers)
- [ ] Add team filtering
- [ ] Add "active/inactive" status filtering
- [ ] Fuzzy matching for misspellings
- [ ] Search history/recent searches

### Contracts
- [ ] Add contract comparison tools
- [ ] Visualize contract timeline
- [ ] Show contract efficiency metrics
- [ ] Add cap hit projections
- [ ] Contract expiry alerts
