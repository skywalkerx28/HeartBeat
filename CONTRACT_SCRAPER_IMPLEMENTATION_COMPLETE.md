# Contract Scraper Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive contract scraping system that extracts NHL player contract data from CapWages.com and automatically maps player names to their official NHL player IDs.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Contract-Only Scraping (No Player Stats)
- **Removed**: All player statistics scraping code
- **Focus**: Exclusively on contract details and financial data
- **Database**: Removed player_career_stats table and functions
- **CSV Export**: Only contract-related files generated

### 2. Player Name to ID Mapping System
- **Intelligent Matching**: Handles multiple name formats
  - "Sidney#87 Crosby" ‚Üí 8471675
  - "Sidney Crosby" ‚Üí 8471675
  - "Crosby, Sidney" ‚Üí 8471675
  - "Crosby" (with team) ‚Üí 8471675

- **Mapping Methods**:
  1. **Exact Match**: Normalized name matching
  2. **Fuzzy Match**: 85% similarity threshold using SequenceMatcher
  3. **Last Name + Team**: Fallback for partial names

- **Data Source**: `/data/processed/rosters/unified_roster_20252026.json`
  - 769 NHL players
  - 1,536 name lookup entries
  - Official NHL player IDs

### 3. Enhanced CSV File Naming
- **New Format**: `lastname_playerid_type_timestamp.csv`
- **Example**: `crosby_8471675_contracts_20251016_161342.csv`
- **No Jersey Number**: Clean filenames without #87 or similar
- **Components**:
  - Last name (lowercase)
  - NHL Player ID
  - File type (contracts, contract_details, summary)
  - Timestamp

### 4. Enriched Data Export

#### CSV Files Generated (3 files per player):
1. **Contracts**: `lastname_playerid_contracts_timestamp.csv`
2. **Contract Details**: `lastname_playerid_contract_details_timestamp.csv`
3. **Summary**: `lastname_playerid_summary_timestamp.csv`

#### Summary CSV Includes:
```csv

NHL Player ID,8471675
Official Name,Sidney Crosby
Current Team,PIT
Position,C
Number,#87
Export Date,2025-10-16 16:13:42
