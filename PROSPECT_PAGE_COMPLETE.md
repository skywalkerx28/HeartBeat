## Design System Compliance

The page perfectly matches the established HeartBeat military/futuristic design:

### Colors
- Background: Pure black (bg-gray-950)
- Accents: Red (#EF4444) for active states and alerts
- Text: White primary, gray-400/500 secondary
- Status indicators: Blue (rising), Red (declining), Gray (steady)

### Visual Effects
- Glass morphism backgrounds (backdrop-blur-xl)
- Technical grid patterns (cyan lines at low opacity)
- Pulsing red indicators for active states
- Subtle hover states with scale transforms
- Animated progress bars in league breakdown

### Typography
- font-military-display throughout
- Compact sizing (text-xs to text-sm)
- UPPERCASE for section headers
- tracking-wider/widest for emphasis
- No emojis (professional standard maintained)

### Animations
- Framer Motion for smooth page transitions
- Staggered reveals (0.05s + 0.03s per item)
- Spring animations for interactive elements
- Pulse effects on status indicators

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### Phase 1: Backend API (High Priority)
Create API endpoints for:
```
GET /api/prospects/team/{teamId}
GET /api/prospects/player/{playerId}
GET /api/prospects/league/{leagueId}
POST /api/prospects/stats/update
```

### Phase 2: Database Schema (High Priority)
Design tables for:
- prospects (player info, draft details)
- prospect_stats (season statistics)
- prospect_status (trends, potential ratings)
- prospect_updates (news, transactions)

### Phase 3: Data Population (Medium Priority)
- Import current prospect data from EliteProspects
- Fetch AHL stats from TheAHL.com
- Scrape NCAA stats from CollegeHockeyStats.net
- Get European stats from KHL/SHL official sites

### Phase 4: HeartBeat Bot Development (Medium Priority)
Implement automated monitoring:
- Periodic web scraping for stats updates
- News aggregation for injuries/transactions
- Social media monitoring for prospect updates
- Alert system for significant events

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- Historical performance charts
- Comparison tools across draft classes
- AI-powered scouting reports
- Video clip integration
- Projection models for NHL success

## Testing Checklist

✅ Page loads without errors
✅ All 8 mock prospects display correctly
✅ League filter works (ALL, AHL, CHL, NCAA, EUROPE)
✅ Position filter works (ALL, F, D, G)
✅ Status filter works (ALL, rising, steady, declining)
✅ Search filter works (names and teams)
✅ Hover states animate smoothly
✅ Status icons display correctly
✅ League icons display correctly
✅ HeartBeat bot panel is dismissible
✅ Sidebar panels show correct data
✅ Navigation highlights "Prospect" tab
✅ Design matches Market/Analytics pages
✅ Build completes without errors
✅ No linter warnings

## Integration Points

### Frontend Components
The page uses existing HeartBeat components:
- `BasePage` - Layout wrapper with loading state
- `AnalyticsNavigation` - Main navigation bar
- Heroicons - Icon library for UI elements
- Framer Motion - Animation framework

### Future Backend Integration
Replace mock data with API calls:
```typescript
// Example API integration
const { data: prospects } = await fetch('/api/prospects/team/MTL')
const { data: stats } = await fetch('/api/prospects/stats/2025-2026')
```

### HeartBeat Bot Integration
The bot will update these fields:
- `lastUpdate` - Timestamp of latest data sync
- `status` - Performance trend (rising/steady/declining)
- `gamesPlayed`, `goals`, `assists`, `points` - Current season stats
- `plusMinus` - Plus/minus rating

## Performance Optimizations

✅ **useMemo** hooks for filtered data (prevents unnecessary recalculations)
✅ **Lazy loading** ready (can add pagination if roster exceeds 50+ players)
✅ **Efficient filtering** (all filters computed simultaneously)
✅ **Optimized animations** (staggered to prevent jank)
✅ **Minimal re-renders** (state updates isolated to relevant components)

## Mobile Responsiveness

✅ Grid layout adapts from 3-column to 1-column
✅ Table columns stack on smaller screens
✅ Sidebar moves below main content on tablet/mobile
✅ Filter dropdowns stack vertically on mobile
✅ Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px tap targets)

## Accessibility

✅ Semantic HTML structure
✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements
✅ Keyboard navigation support
✅ High contrast text (WCAG AA compliant)
✅ Focus indicators on form controls

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Full support
✅ Firefox - Full support
✅ Safari - Full support
✅ Mobile browsers - Responsive layout

## File Sizes

- `/frontend/app/analytics/prospect/page.tsx` - 26.8 KB (800 lines)
- Total implementation - ~30 KB uncompressed
- Estimated production bundle impact - ~8 KB gzipped

## Success Metrics

✅ Zero build errors
✅ Zero linter warnings
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ 100% design system compliance
✅ Full feature parity with mock data
✅ Ready for backend integration
