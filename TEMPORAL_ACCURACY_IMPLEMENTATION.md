# Temporal Accuracy Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

Implemented **temporal accuracy** for all injury reports and transactions by displaying the **actual event date** instead of when we scraped the data. This ensures users know exactly when NHL events occurred, not when our bot discovered them.

**Completion Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üéØ **Problem Solved**

**Before**: Events showed "Just now", "3h ago", etc. based on when we scraped them  
**After**: Events show the actual date they occurred (e.g., "Today", "Yesterday", "Oct 15")

---

## ‚úÖ **What Was Changed**

### **1. Backend - API Model Updates**

**File**: `backend/api/models/news.py`

Added clear distinction between event date and scrape date:

```python
class Transaction(BaseModel):
    """NHL transaction model"""
    date: DateType = Field(description="Actual transaction date (when event occurred)")
    created_at: datetime = Field(description="When we scraped this transaction")
```

**Result**: API now returns both the actual event date and scrape timestamp

---

### **2. Frontend - InjuriesTracker.tsx**

**Changes**:
- Updated interface to include both `date` (event date) and `created_at` (scrape date)
- Created `formatDate()` function for smart date display:
  - **Today** - if event happened today
  - **Yesterday** - if event was yesterday
  - **"3d ago"** - for events within last week
  - **"Oct 15"** - for older events (shows month + day)
- Display actual injury date in UI instead of scrape time

**UI Display**:
```
JAKUB DEREK                           OUT
VGK                                   
NHL Injury Status - 2025-26 Season   
                                  TODAY ‚Üê Actual event date
```

---

### **3. Frontend - TransactionsQuickFeed.tsx**

**Changes**:
- Updated interface to include both `date` and `created_at`
- Applied same `formatDate()` logic
- Display actual transaction date in UI

**UI Display**:
```
‚Üí ALEXANDAR GEORGIEV              YESTERDAY
BUF ‚Üí BUF                         WAIVER
```

---

## üìä **Date Display Logic**

```javascript
formatDate(dateString) {
  const diffDays = calculateDaysDifference(dateString, now)
  
  if (diffDays === 0) return 'Today'
  if (diffDays === 1) return 'Yesterday'  
  if (diffDays < 7) return `${diffDays}d ago`
  
  // Older events show actual date
  return `${month} ${day}`  // e.g., "Oct 15"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Recent events** are intuitive ("Today", "Yesterday")
- ‚úÖ **This week** shows relative days ("3d ago")
- ‚úÖ **Older events** show actual dates ("Oct 15", "Sep 28")
- ‚úÖ Users always know WHEN the event happened, not when we found it

---

## üîÑ **Data Flow**

```
NHL Source ‚Üí Scraper (extracts event date) ‚Üí Database (stores both dates)
                                                      ‚Üì
API (returns both: event date + scrape timestamp) ‚Üí Frontend (displays event date)
```

**Key Fields**:
- `transaction_date` / `date` - When the event actually occurred ‚úÖ
- `created_at` - When we scraped it (for internal tracking)

---

## üìà **Examples**

### **Injury Reports**
```
ZACH HYMAN                        OUT
                                TODAY

RYAN STROME                      INJURY  
ANA                             3D AGO

JAKE WALMAN                     INJURY
EDM                             OCT 12
```

### **Transactions**
```
‚Üí CONOR SHEARY               YESTERDAY
ACTIVATE

‚Üí KEVIN ROONEY                  5D AGO
UTA ‚Üí UTA                      WAIVER

‚Üí VILLE HUSSO                  OCT 13
ANA ‚Üí ANA                      WAIVER
```

## ‚úÖ **Benefits**

1. **Temporal Accuracy** - Users know exactly when events happened
2. **Trust** - Transparent about event timing vs. reporting timing
3. **Context** - Users can assess relevance based on actual date
4. **Professional** - Matches industry standards (ESPN, NHL.com, etc.)

---

## üöÄ **Impact**

**Users can now**:
- ‚úÖ See exactly when a player was injured
- ‚úÖ Know when a transaction actually occurred
- ‚úÖ Assess information freshness accurately
- ‚úÖ Trust the temporal integrity of our data

**No more confusion** about whether "3h ago" means the event happened 3 hours ago or we found it 3 hours ago!

---

## üìù **Technical Notes**

- Database already had `transaction_date` field - leveraged existing schema
- API models updated with field descriptions for clarity
- Frontend components use unified date formatting logic
- Graceful fallback for missing dates (though all should have them)

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ All injury reports and transactions now display actual event dates
