# Player Progression Charts - Implementation Complete

## Overview

We've built a state-of-the-art player profile system with **game-by-game cumulative progression charts** that show how player stats accumulate throughout NHL seasons.

---

## What We've Built

### 1. **Complete NHL Player Database** (850 Players)
- **850 player profiles** cached locally (`data/processed/player_profiles/profiles/`)
- Bio data, career totals, season-by-season stats
- Fetched from NHL API: `/v1/player/{id}/landing`

### 2. **Comprehensive Game Logs** (371,554 Games)
- **9,733 game log files** across 22 seasons (2003-2025)
- Game-by-game stats for every player
- Separate files for regular season vs playoffs
- Fetched from NHL API: `/v1/player/{id}/game-log/{season}/{type}`

### 3. **Cumulative Progression Data** (9,733 Aggregated Files)
- **Pre-computed cumulative stats** for all players/seasons
- Game-by-game running totals (assists, goals, points, etc.)
- Optimized for fast charting
- Location: `data/processed/player_profiles/aggregated_stats/`

### 4. **Interactive Progression Charts**
- **14 metrics** available for charting:
  - Points (PTS), Goals (G), Assists (A), Plus/Minus (+/-)
  - PP Goals (PPG), PP Points (PPP)
  - Game Winning Goals (GWG), OT Goals (OTG)
  - Shots (SOG), Shifts per Game (SFT/G)
  - Shorthanded Goals (SHG), Shorthanded Points (SHP)
  - Penalty Minutes (PIM), TOI per Game (TOI/G)
  
- **Season selection**: Last 8 seasons per player
- **X-axis**: Game-by-game dates (Oct-Apr)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative metric value
- **Hover tooltips**: Show individual game stats + cumulative total

## 📊 How the Charts Work

### Example: Auston Matthews 2024-25 Season, Assists

**Data Flow:**
1. User selects **"2024-25"** season and **"Assists"** metric
2. Frontend fetches: `/api/nhl/player/8479318/cumulative/20242025/regular`
3. Backend loads: `data/processed/player_profiles/aggregated_stats/8479318/20242025_regular_cumulative.json`
4. Chart displays cumulative assists by game date:
   - Oct 9: 0 assists (season opener)
   - Oct 12: 1 assist (cumulative: 1)
   - Oct 15: 2 assists in game (cumulative: 3)
   - Oct 18: 0 assists (cumulative: 3, flat line)
   - ... continues through April

**Chart Features:**
- **Area chart** with gradient fill (Perplexity-style)
- **Smooth progression line** showing stat accumulation over time
- **Interactive tooltips** with:
  - Game date, opponent, home/away
  - Cumulative total at that point
  - Individual game stats
  - Game score line (G-A-P)
