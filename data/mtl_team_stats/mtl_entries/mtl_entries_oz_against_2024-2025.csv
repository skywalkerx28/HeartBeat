# Montreal Canadiens - Opponent Team Offensive Zone Controlled Entry Against Montreal Analysis 2024-2025
# Shows how opponents execute controlled entries when attacking Montreal's defensive gap control and zone entry prevention
# Measures controlled entry pressure Montreal faces and their defensive ability to limit opponent skill-based zone access
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Opponent Controlled Entry Execution vs Montreal's Defensive Systems
# This data shows how effectively opponents execute controlled entries against Montreal's defensive gap control,
# neutral zone coverage, and entry prevention systems. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior
# defensive positioning and pressure that forces opponents into dump-in situations rather than maintaining possession
# through controlled entries, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully exploiting Montreal's defensive gaps.
#
# Opponent controlled entry strategies against Montreal:
# - Individual carry-in attempts targeting Montreal's weaker gap control or defensive positioning vulnerabilities
# - Team-based pass controlled entries exploiting Montreal's defensive coverage gaps and communication breakdowns
# - Sustained offensive pressure creation through successful controlled entry execution against Montreal's defensive system
# - Immediate offensive conversion following successful entries to capitalize on Montreal's defensive zone coverage
# - Odd-man rush exploitation when Montreal's defensive positioning creates numerical disadvantage situations
# - Strategic entry timing recognition when Montreal's defensive pressure and gap control create execution opportunities
#
# Strategic factors opponents consider against Montreal:
# - Montreal's individual defensive gap control effectiveness and neutral zone coverage system strengths/weaknesses
# - Personnel matchup exploitation targeting Montreal's weaker individual defenders or defensive pairs in entry situations
# - Game situation timing when Montreal's defensive intensity or positioning creates controlled entry opportunities
# - Montreal's defensive zone setup and coverage patterns affecting immediate offensive execution following successful entries
# - Support system exploitation when Montreal's defensive support positioning creates vulnerability windows for sustained pressure
# - Offensive zone presence creation through effective controlled entry execution against Montreal's defensive transition coverage
#
