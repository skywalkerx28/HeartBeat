#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Controlled Entry Execution and Offensive Zone Access
# Controlled entries represent the highest-skill method of gaining offensive zone access while maintaining puck
# possession, as opposed to dump-ins that surrender possession. These entries require individual skill, team
# coordination, and tactical execution to beat opponent defensive pressure and gap control. Successful controlled
# entries lead directly to higher-quality scoring opportunities and sustained offensive zone time, making them
# a critical separator between elite and average offensive systems in modern NHL hockey.
#
# Key controlled entry execution types Montreal employs:
# - Carry-in entries: Individual skill plays where players beat defenders 1-on-1 to gain zone access with possession
# - Pass controlled entries: Team-based entries using passing combinations to beat defensive coverage and maintain possession
# - Play continuation: Converting successful entries into immediate offensive pressure and sustained zone time
# - Shot generation: Creating immediate shooting opportunities directly following successful controlled entry execution
# - Scoring chance creation: Converting controlled entries into high-quality scoring opportunities and net-front presence
# - Odd-man rush creation: Exploiting defensive gaps through controlled entries to create numerical advantages
#
# Strategic controlled entry factors Montreal considers:
# - Opponent defensive gap control and neutral zone coverage affecting entry method selection and timing
# - Personnel matchups and individual skill advantages for carry-in entries vs team-based passing combinations
# - Game situation management balancing risk-taking for controlled entries vs safer dump-in strategic alternatives
# - Support positioning and offensive zone setup for immediate play continuation following successful entry execution
# - Defensive pressure assessment and timing recognition for optimal controlled entry execution under pressure
# - Sustained offensive zone presence creation through effective entry execution and immediate offensive system deployment
