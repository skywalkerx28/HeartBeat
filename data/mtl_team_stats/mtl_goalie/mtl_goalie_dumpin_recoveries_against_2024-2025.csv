# Montreal Canadiens - Opponent Team Goaltending Dump-In Recovery Against Montreal Analysis 2024-2025
# Shows how opponent goaltenders handle Montreal's dump-in tactics through puck-handling and breakout support
# Measures goaltending pressure Montreal faces and their ability to exploit opponent goalie puck-handling weaknesses
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Opponent Goaltender Puck-Handling vs Montreal's Dump-In Strategy
# This data shows how effectively opponent goaltenders serve as a "third defenseman" when defending against
# Montreal's dump-in attacks. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's effective dump-in placement and
# forechecking pressure that disrupts opponent goalie puck-handling, while higher rates suggest opponents
# have strong puck-playing goalies who effectively neutralize Montreal's dump-in strategic approach.
#
# Opponent goaltender defensive scenarios against Montreal:
# - Reading Montreal's dump-in types and making appropriate recovery decisions under forechecking pressure
