# Montreal Canadiens - Opponent Team Possession Success Rate Against Montreal Analysis 2024-2025
# Shows how opponents maintain possession and protect pucks when playing against Montreal's defensive pressure systems
# Measures puck protection pressure Montreal creates and their defensive ability to force opponent turnovers and possession failures
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Opponent Puck Protection vs Montreal's Defensive Pressure
# This data shows how effectively opponents maintain puck control and avoid turnovers when facing Montreal's defensive
# pressure, gap control, and coverage systems. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior defensive
# pressure and positioning that forces opponent possession failures and turnover creation, while higher rates suggest
# opponents successfully protecting pucks and maintaining possession despite Montreal's defensive pressure and
# systematic coverage interference through superior puck handling skills and pressure response capabilities.
#
# Opponent puck protection examples scenarios against Montreal's defensive pressure:
# - Offensive zone possession: Maintaining puck control under Montreal's defensive zone coverage and pressure for sustained attacks
# - Defensive zone possession: Secure breakout execution despite Montreal's forechecking pressure and gap control interference
