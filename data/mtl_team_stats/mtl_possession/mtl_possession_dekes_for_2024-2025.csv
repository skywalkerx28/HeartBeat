# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Individual Skill and Creative Puck-Handling Excellence
# Open ice dekes represent individual skill moves and creative deception tactics where Montreal players use technical
# excellence, creativity, and puck-handling skills to beat opponents 1-on-1 through pure talent rather than system
# execution. Successful dekes create space, beat defensive pressure, and generate tactical advantages through individual
# brilliance and creative problem-solving. Zone-specific deke applications serve different tactical purposes and require
# varying risk tolerance, technical execution, and creative decision-making based on game situation and strategic needs.

# - Offensive zone dekes: Creative space creation for shooting opportunities, beating defenders in tight spaces
# - Defensive zone dekes: Pressure relief and breakout initiation through individual skill under forechecking pressure
# - Neutral zone dekes: Transition advantage creation and defensive gap exploitation through individual creativity
# - 1-on-1 skill battles: Direct individual confrontations using deception and technical excellence to gain advantages
