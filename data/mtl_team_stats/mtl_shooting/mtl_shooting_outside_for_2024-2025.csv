# Montreal Canadiens - Team Outside Slot Shooting and Perimeter Offense Analysis 2024-2025
# Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's outside slot shooting effectiveness, volume creation, and perimeter offensive execution
# Advanced perimeter shooting metrics showing point shot effectiveness, pressure management, and strategic volume generation
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Outside Slot Perimeter Shooting and Volume Creation Strategy
# The outside slot represents the perimeter shooting areas beyond the high-danger slot zone, extending from the
# faceoff circle tops and dots outward toward the blue line and offensive zone perimeter. While offering lower
# conversion rates than high-danger areas, outside slot shooting serves critical tactical purposes: creating rebounds
# for high-danger area players, establishing offensive zone presence, generating shot volume for momentum, and
# forcing goaltenders to make saves that can create second-chance opportunities through strategic positioning.
#
# Key outside slot shooting tactical purposes examples Montreal employs:
# - Point shooting: Perimeter shots from defensemen creating screens, rebounds, and deflection opportunities for forwards
# - Volume generation: Strategic shot attempts maintaining offensive pressure and territorial control through sustained attack
# - Rebound creation: Lower-percentage shots designed to generate second-chance opportunities for high-danger area players
# - Goaltender pressure: Forcing saves and movement to create positioning challenges and rebound availability
# - Screen establishment: Using perimeter shots to create visual obstacles while teammates position for rebounds and deflections
# - Momentum maintenance: Sustaining offensive zone presence and pressure through consistent shooting and puck pursuit
#
# Strategic outside slot factors Montreal considers:
# - Tactical purpose assessment balancing shot quality vs rebound creation and momentum maintenance through volume generation
# - Screen coordination utilizing perimeter shots to create visual obstacles while teammates establish high-danger positioning
# - Rebound positioning ensuring proper net-front presence when taking lower-percentage shots for second-chance creation
# - Game situation management affecting perimeter shooting selection and volume generation for tactical advantages
# - Personnel deployment utilizing defensemen and perimeter players for point shooting and offensive zone pressure maintenance
# - Pressure maintenance through strategic volume shooting when high-danger opportunities aren't available for sustained attack
#
# KEY OUTSIDE SLOT SHOOTING METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Perimeter Success Rate: Shooting effectiveness from lower-percentage areas (volume and tactical purpose measurement)
# - Pressure vs No Pressure: Shooting execution under defensive coverage from perimeter locations (technique indicator)
# - Volume Distribution: Outside slot shooting frequency showing Montreal's perimeter offensive emphasis and tactical approach
# - True Shooting %: Conversion efficiency from lower-percentage areas (realistic expectations for perimeter effectiveness)
# - Tactical effectiveness showing Montreal's ability to create offensive pressure and rebound opportunities through perimeter shooting
# - Strategic volume generation measuring Montreal's sustained offensive zone presence and pressure maintenance through perimeter execution
