# Montreal Canadiens - Team Screened Shots and Tactical Screening Analysis 2024-2025
# Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's screened shot effectiveness, tactical coordination, and goaltender obstruction by location
# Advanced screening metrics showing net-front coordination, visual obstruction tactics, and location-specific screened shooting success
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Tactical Screening and Goaltender Obstruction Strategy
# Screened shots represent sophisticated offensive coordination where Montreal players position themselves to obstruct
# the goaltender's visual sight lines while teammates shoot from various locations. Effective screening requires precise
# positioning, timing coordination, and physical presence to create visual obstacles without goaltender interference
# penalties. Screened shots significantly increase conversion rates by reducing goaltender reaction time and positioning
# effectiveness, while also creating higher rebound percentages for second-chance opportunities through tactical coordination.
#
# Key tactical screening scenarios examples Montreal employs by location:
# - Inner slot screening: Elite net-front positioning creating visual obstacles for highest-danger area shots
# - Slot area screening: High-danger zone coordination with screen players obstructing goaltender sight lines
# - Point shot screening: Defensemen shooting with forwards creating screens for increased effectiveness and rebound creation
# - Outer slot screening: Perimeter shot coordination using tactical positioning for visual obstruction and goaltender interference
# - Screen timing: Coordinated movement and positioning ensuring visual obstruction without goaltender interference penalties
# - Rebound positioning: Screen players prepared for second-chance opportunities following screened shot attempts
#
# Strategic screening factors Montreal considers:
# - Visual obstruction timing and positioning coordination for maximum goaltender sight line interference without penalties
# - Location-specific screening techniques adapting to different shooting angles and goaltender positioning requirements
# - Personnel coordination between shooters and screen players for optimal tactical execution and timing synchronization
# - Rebound positioning ensuring screen players are prepared for second-chance opportunities following screened shots
# - Game situation management affecting screening risk tolerance and tactical coordination for strategic advantages
# - Goaltender exploitation recognizing positioning tendencies and visual weaknesses for improved screening effectiveness
#
# KEY TACTICAL SCREENING METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Location-Specific Success: Screened shot effectiveness from different offensive zone areas (tactical coordination measurement)
# - Rebound Creation: Second-chance opportunity generation through screened shots (tactical effectiveness indicator)
# - True Shooting %: Pure finishing efficiency with visual obstruction advantages (coordination and execution measurement)
# - Overall Screening Success: Complete tactical coordination effectiveness across all locations and shooting scenarios
# - Tactical coordination showing Montreal's ability to execute sophisticated offensive systems requiring precise positioning
# - Visual obstruction effectiveness measuring Montreal's screening coordination and goaltender interference tactical success
