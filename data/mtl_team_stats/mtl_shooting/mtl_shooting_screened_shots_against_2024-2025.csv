# This data shows how effectively opponents execute tactical screening and goaltender obstruction when facing Montreal's
# defensive zone coverage and goaltending systems. Higher opponent screened shot success rates indicate Montreal's
# defensive positioning vulnerabilities that allow effective visual obstruction and coordinated offensive execution,
# while lower rates suggest Montreal's superior defensive coverage and screen clearing that limits opponent tactical
# advantages through coordinated defensive positioning and effective screen battle technique.
