# Montreal Canadiens - Opponent Team Defensive Zone Passing Against Montreal Analysis 2024-2025
# Shows how opponents execute defensive zone passing and breakout systems when facing Montreal's forechecking pressure
# Measures DZ passing pressure Montreal creates and their forechecking ability to disrupt opponent breakout execution
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Opponent Defensive Zone Passing vs Montreal's Forechecking Systems
# This data shows how effectively opponents execute their defensive zone passing and breakout systems when facing
# Montreal's forechecking pressure, gap control, and defensive zone coverage. Lower opponent success rates indicate
# Montreal's superior forechecking intensity and positioning that forces opponent breakout failures and extended
# defensive zone time, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully executing clean breakouts despite Montreal's
# forechecking pressure and systematic defensive zone coverage interference.
#
# Opponent defensive zone passing examples scenarios against Montreal's forechecking:
# - Outlet pass execution under Montreal's aggressive forechecking pressure and support positioning interference
# - Stretch pass attempts trying to bypass Montreal's neutral zone coverage and gap control through long-range passing
# - D2D passing coordination despite Montreal's forechecking disruption and defensive positioning pressure
# - Breakout system execution maintenance under Montreal's systematic forechecking pressure and coverage intensity
# - Pressure relief passing when Montreal's forechecking creates sustained defensive zone pressure and limited options
# - Risk assessment balancing aggressive breakout attempts vs safe clearing under Montreal's forechecking intensity
#
# Strategic factors opponents consider against Montreal's forechecking systems:
# - Montreal's forechecking pressure timing and intensity affecting opponent breakout pass selection and execution
# - Montreal's gap control and neutral zone coverage limiting opponent stretch pass options and transition effectiveness
# - Montreal's defensive zone positioning and support affecting opponent outlet pass availability and execution timing
# - Personnel deployment exploitation when Montreal's forechecking creates breakout passing opportunities through positioning gaps
# - Game situation factors affecting risk tolerance for aggressive breakout execution vs safe clearing under Montreal pressure
# - Breakout system coordination maintenance despite Montreal's forechecking disruption and systematic pressure application
#
# KEY OPPONENT DZ PASSING METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Opponent Outlet Success (+Against): Primary breakout effectiveness when facing Montreal's forechecking pressure
# - Opponent Stretch Success (+Against): Long-range passing accuracy despite Montreal's neutral zone coverage
# - Opponent D2D Success (+Against): Defenseman coordination effectiveness under Montreal's forechecking disruption
# - Opponent Tendency (+Against): Pass type selection when facing Montreal's forechecking systems and pressure
# - Opponent Overall DZ Success (+Against): Complete breakout effectiveness when facing Montreal's forechecking coverage
# - Lower opponent rates indicate Montreal's strong forechecking pressure disrupting opponent breakout systems
# - Higher rates suggest opponents successfully executing breakout systems despite Montreal's forechecking intensity
# - (+Against) shows opponent breakout effectiveness when facing Montreal's forechecking systems and defensive pressure
