#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Advanced Offensive Zone Passing Tactics and Scoring Chance Creation
# Offensive zone passing represents the most sophisticated tactical execution in hockey, requiring precise timing,
# spatial awareness, and coordination to create high-quality scoring opportunities against organized defensive systems.
# Different passing patterns serve specific tactical purposes: slot passes create net-front chances, off-the-rush
# passes exploit transition advantages, directional passes manipulate defensive coverage, and one-timer setups
# generate immediate high-danger shooting opportunities with minimal goaltender reaction time.
#
# Key advanced OZ passing tactics examples scenarios for Montreal:
# - Slot passes: High-danger area feeding for net-front presence, deflections, and close-range scoring opportunities
# - Off-the-rush passes: Exploiting transition speed and defensive gaps for immediate offensive execution
# - North-South passes: Vertical puck movement creating depth and pulling defenders out of position
# - East-West passes: Lateral movement opening shooting lanes and creating cross-ice one-timer opportunities
# - One-timer setups: Creating immediate shooting opportunities with minimal goaltender positioning time
# - Directional manipulation: Using passing patterns to move defensive coverage and create tactical advantages
#
# Strategic OZ passing system factors Montreal considers:
# - Defensive coverage recognition and manipulation through strategic passing pattern selection and execution timing
# - High-danger area creation through slot feeding and net-front setup passing under defensive pressure
# - Transition exploitation using off-the-rush passing to capitalize on speed advantages and defensive gaps
# - Shooting lane creation through directional passing patterns that move defensive coverage and create opportunities
# - One-timer generation maximizing shooting effectiveness through pass timing and positioning coordination
# - Sustained pressure maintenance through effective cycle passing and possession control under defensive pressure
#
# KEY ADVANCED OZ PASSING METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Slot Pass Success: High-danger area feeding effectiveness (critical for net-front scoring chance creation)
# - Off-the-Rush Success: Transition advantage exploitation through immediate offensive execution
# - Directional Success (N/S/E-W): Tactical passing pattern effectiveness at manipulating defensive coverage
# - One-Timer Creation: Setup passing leading to immediate high-danger shooting opportunities
# - Passing Tendency: Strategic pattern selection showing Montreal's offensive system preferences and tactical emphasis
# - Overall OZ effectiveness showing Montreal's sophisticated offensive zone execution and scoring chance creation systems
