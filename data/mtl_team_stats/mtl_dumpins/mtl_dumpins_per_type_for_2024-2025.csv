# Detailed breakdown of Montreal's dump-in strategies by tactical type and recovery effectiveness
# Advanced offensive zone entry tactics showing strategic dump-in selection and recovery success rates
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Strategic Dump-In Tactical Breakdown
# Dump-ins are strategic offensive plays where Montreal intentionally shoots the puck into the opponent's
# zone to establish forechecking pressure, change lines, or gain territorial advantage when controlled
# entries aren't available or is not the best option in this given situation.. Different dump-in types serve specific tactical purposes based on game
# situation, opponent positioning, and forechecking strategy. Recovery rates show offensive effectiveness.
#
# Key dump-in tactical types Montreal uses:
# - Rim Dump-Ins: Around the boards behind the net for forechecking battles and puck retrieval
# - Cross-Ice Dump-Ins: Diagonal dumps across the ice to change the point of attack and create confusion
# - Same-Side Dump-Ins: Keeping possession on the same side for predictable forechecking support
# - Soft Dump-Ins: Controlled, softer dumps allowing forecheckers time to arrive and establish pressure
#
# Strategic dump-in selection factors:
# - Line change opportunities (soft dumps to buy time)
# - Opponent defensive positioning (cross-ice to exploit gaps)
# - Forechecking personnel (rim dumps for physical forecheckers)
# - Game situation (protecting leads vs chasing goals)
# - Zone entry pressure (when controlled entries are denied)
#
# KEY TACTICAL DUMP-IN METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Recovery Rate: How often Montreal regains possession after each dump-in type (higher = better forechecking)
# - Shot On Net After: Percentage of recoveries leading to immediate shooting opportunities
# - Scoring Chance After: Percentage of recoveries creating quality scoring chances
# - Tactical effectiveness measured by recovery success and offensive opportunity creation
# - Different types show Montreal's strategic adaptability and forechecking system effectiveness
