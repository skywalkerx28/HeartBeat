# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Offensive System Conversion and Scoring Chance Creation
# Scoring chances represent the ultimate conversion of tactical systems into actual goal-scoring opportunities, measuring
# how effectively Montreal's various offensive systems create high-quality looks and sustained pressure. Different
# tactical approaches (rush, cycle, forecheck, OZ play) generate different types of scoring chances with varying
# success rates and goal conversion. Territorial control percentages show game flow dominance and system effectiveness
# in controlling pace, momentum, and strategic advantages throughout games.
#
# Key scoring chance creation systems examples scenarios for Montreal:
# - Off-the-rush chances: Speed-based scoring opportunities exploiting transition advantages and defensive gaps
# - Off-the-cycle chances: Sustained pressure scoring opportunities through puck movement and defensive coverage manipulation
# - Off-the-forecheck chances: Aggressive pressure creating turnovers and immediate high-danger scoring opportunities
# - OZ play chances: Sustained offensive zone presence creating multiple scoring opportunities through system execution
# - Second-chance opportunities: Rebound battles and net-front presence creating additional high-danger scoring chances
# - Slot shot execution: High-danger area shooting from the most statistically successful scoring location
#

# - System selection based on game situation, opponent weaknesses, and personnel matchup advantages
