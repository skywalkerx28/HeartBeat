# This data shows how effectively opponents use precise stick work to disrupt Montreal's puck handling
# and create turnovers through skilled defensive play. Lower opponent stick check numbers may indicate
# Montreal's superior puck protection skills and ability to handle defensive pressure, while higher
# numbers suggest opponents are successfully targeting Montreal with active stick-on-stick defensive play.

# Opponent stick checks that simply disrupt Montreal's play or slow them down without creating a turnover
# are NOT included in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE opponent stick work that directly
# creates possession changes from Montreal, not just defensive contact or disruption attempts.
