# Montreal Canadiens - Team Body Checks Analysis 2024-2025
# Measures Montreal's physical engagement and successful body contact across all three zones
# Advanced physical play metrics showing hitting effectiveness, intimidation factor, and zone-specific physical presence
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Physical Play and Body Contact Engagement
# Body checks are deliberate physical contact plays where Montreal players use their body to
# separate opponents from the puck, disrupt plays, or establish physical dominance. Successful
# body checks can create turnovers, momentum shifts, and psychological advantages while wearing
# down opponents physically and mentally throughout the game.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: These body checks are ONLY counted when they result in a change of puck possession.
# A body check where a player simply finishes their hit without creating a turnover is NOT included
# in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE body checking that directly impacts puck control,
# not just physical contact for intimidation or momentum purposes.
#
# Key physical engagement scenarios Montreal creates:
# - Finishing checks along the boards to separate opponents from pucks
# - Open-ice hits to disrupt opponent rushes and create turnovers
# - Net-front physical battles to clear opponents from scoring areas
# - Forechecking pressure with body contact to force quick decisions
# - Defensive zone clearing hits to regain puck possession
# - Momentum-building hits to energize teammates and intimidate opponents
#
# KEY PHYSICAL PLAY METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - OZ Body Checks: Physical contact in opponent territory (forechecking pressure, board battles)
# - DZ Body Checks: Home zone physical play (counterchecking along the boards on breakouts, clearing the net, defensive battles, puck separation)
# - NZ Body Checks: Neutral zone hits (disrupting rushes, transition defense, momentum shifts)
# - Total Body Checks: Combined effective physical plays across all zones (higher = more turnover-creating hits)
# - Successful indicates clean, effective contact that CREATES TURNOVERS and disrupts opponent possession without penalties
