# Montreal Canadiens - Team Stick Checks Analysis 2024-2025
# Measures Montreal's skill-based defensive engagement and successful stick work across all three zones
# Advanced stick-on-stick defensive metrics showing defensive skill, timing, and turnover creation through active stick play
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Skill-Based Defensive Stick Work
# Stick checks are precise defensive plays where Montreal players use their stick to disrupt opponent
# puck handling, break up passes, or force turnovers through active stick work. These require excellent
# timing, positioning, and stick skills rather than physical contact. Successful stick checks demonstrate
# defensive hockey IQ and technical proficiency in disrupting plays without body contact.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: These stick checks are ONLY counted when they result in a change of puck possession.
# Stick checks that simply disrupt a play, slow an opponent, or break up a pass without creating a turnover
# are NOT included in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE stick work that directly creates possession
# changes for Montreal, not just defensive contact or disruption.
#
# Key stick checking scenarios Montreal creates:
# - Poke checks to strip pucks from opponent stick handling in tight spaces
# - Stick lifts to disrupt opponent shots, passes, or puck control
# - Active stick positioning to intercept passes and deflect pucks
# - Defensive zone stick work to break up cycles and regain possession
# - Neutral zone stick checks to create transition opportunities
# - Forechecking stick pressure to force turnovers in offensive zone
#
# KEY STICK WORK METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - OZ Stick Checks: Skill-based turnovers in opponent territory (active forechecking, puck disruption)
# - DZ Stick Checks: Home zone stick work (breaking up cycles, intercepting passes, defensive positioning)
# - NZ Stick Checks: Neutral zone stick-on-stick plays (transition defense, pass interruption, gap control)
# - Total Stick Checks: Combined skill-based possession creation across all zones (higher = more effective stick work)
# - Successful indicates precise, well-timed stick work that CREATES TURNOVERS without penalties
