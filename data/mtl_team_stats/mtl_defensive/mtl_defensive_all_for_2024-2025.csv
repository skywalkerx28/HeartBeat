# Montreal Canadiens - Defensive Plays Analysis 2024-2025
# Measures Montreal's active defensive engagement and successful defensive touches across all three zones
# Advanced defensive metrics showing defensive pressure, stick work, and zone-specific defensive effectiveness
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Active Defensive Play Engagement
# Defensive touches represent active defensive plays where Montreal players successfully engage with
# opponents or loose pucks to disrupt offensive plays, regain possession, or prevent scoring chances.
# These are proactive defensive actions rather than passive positioning.
#
# Key defensive engagement exmaple scenarios:
# - Stick checks and poke checks to disrupt opponent puck handling
# - Body positioning and angling to limit opponent options and force turnovers
# - Active stick work to break up passes and shooting lanes
# - Defensive zone coverage including net-front battles and board work
# - Neutral zone gap control and stick-on-puck defensive pressure
# - Effective backchecking 
# - Efficient defensive reloading on the forecheck ( where Montreal defenders efficiently cover and repair gaps created by their teammates forechecking or forward stance.)
#
# KEY DEFENSIVE ENGAGEMENT METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - OZ Defensive Touches: Active defensive plays Montreal makes in opponent territory (backchecking, support)
# - DZ Defensive Touches: Defensive plays in Montreal's zone (coverage, stick checks, puck battles)
