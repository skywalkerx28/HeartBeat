# Montreal Canadiens - Defensive Zone Denials Analysis 2024-2025
# Measures Montreal's ability to prevent opponent entries into their defensive zone
# Advanced defensive metrics showing gap control, neutral zone pressure, and entry prevention success
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Defensive Zone Entry Prevention
# Defensive zone denials are critical defensive plays where Montreal prevents opponents from
# gaining entry into Montreal's defensive zone with possession. This is the first line of defense
# and directly impacts opponent scoring chances and possession time in dangerous areas.
#
# Key defensive scenarios measured:
# - Neutral zone pressure forcing opponent turnovers before zone entry
# - Gap control by Montreal defensemen to deny controlled entries  
# - Active sticks and body positioning to break up entry attempts
# - Forechecking pressure limiting opponent breakout options
# - Defensive zone line battles where Montreal regains possession
# - Limiting opponent cycle opportunities when entries do occur
#
# KEY DEFENSIVE METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - DZ Denial Rate: Percentage of opponent entry attempts Montreal successfully prevents (higher = better defense)
# - Gap Distance: Average distance Montreal defenders maintain from opponents (optimal gap control for denials)
# - NZ Denials: Neutral zone turnovers preventing entry attempts (proactive defense)
# - Entry Denial Rate: Success rate at the defensive zone line (last line of entry prevention)
# - Without Cycle/Shot/Slot percentages: When opponents do enter, how often Montreal limits their effectiveness
