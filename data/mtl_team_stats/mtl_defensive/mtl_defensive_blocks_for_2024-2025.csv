# Montreal Canadiens - Team Shot/Pass Blocking Analysis 2024-2025
# Measures Montreal's defensive lane coverage, shot blocking, and pass disruption across all three zones
# Advanced shot/pass prevention metrics showing defensive positioning, sacrifice plays, and lane discipline
#
# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Defensive Lane Coverage and Shot/Pass Disruption
# Shot and pass blocking represents Montreal's ability to get into shooting and passing lanes to disrupt
# opponent offensive plays through positioning, anticipation, and physical sacrifice. These plays require
# excellent reading of the game, proper positioning, and willingness to put body parts in front of pucks.
# Successful blocks prevent scoring chances and passing plays from developing.
#
# Key defensive blocking scenarios Montreal creates:
# - Getting into shooting lanes to block opponent shot attempts before reaching the goalie
# - Positioning sticks and bodies to intercept cross-ice passes and seam passes
# - Blueline holds to prevent opponent offensive zone entries and maintain pressure
# - Pass lane coverage to break up opponent cycle attempts and zone time
# - Reception prevention by pressuring opponents before they can receive passes cleanly
# - Sacrifice plays that prevent high-danger scoring opportunities from developing
#
# KEY BLOCKING METRICS EXPLAINED:
# - Blocked Shots: Getting into shooting lanes to prevent shots from reaching the goalie (success rate shows effectiveness)
# - Blocked Passes (by zone): Intercepting passes through active positioning in passing lanes
# - Blueline Holds: Maintaining offensive zone pressure by preventing opponent zone exits
# - Reception Preventions: Pressuring opponents to prevent clean pass receptions and puck control
# - Success Rates: Effectiveness percentage for each type of blocking attempt (higher = better positioning/timing)
# - Zone breakdown (OZ/DZ/NZ): Shows where Montreal is most effective at disrupting opponent plays
