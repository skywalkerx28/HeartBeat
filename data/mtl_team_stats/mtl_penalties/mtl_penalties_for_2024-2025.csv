# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Penalty Discipline and Strategic Game Management
# Penalties directly impact game flow through special teams situations, momentum shifts, and tactical advantages.
# Different penalty types serve different purposes: undisciplined penalties represent emotional or technique failures,
# while obstruction penalties may be strategic tactical fouls to prevent scoring chances. Zone-specific penalty
# patterns reveal system discipline, pressure response, and tactical fouling decisions that affect game outcomes
# through power play/penalty kill situations and momentum control throughout games.
