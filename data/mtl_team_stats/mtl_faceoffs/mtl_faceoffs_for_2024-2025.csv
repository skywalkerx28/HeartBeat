# HOCKEY CONTEXT: Faceoff Possession Control and Game Flow Management
# Faceoffs are critical possession battles that occur after stoppages in play, directly determining which team
# gains initial puck control and the opportunity to execute their system. Faceoff success impacts game flow,
# territorial advantage, scoring opportunities, and defensive breakout efficiency. Different zones require
# different strategic approaches and have varying impact levels on game outcomes.
#
# Key faceoff strategic importance by zone:
# - Offensive Zone: Direct scoring opportunity creation through immediate puck control and setup plays
# - Defensive Zone: Clean breakout opportunities and pressure relief through controlled puck possession
# - Neutral Zone: Territorial advantage and transition control for zone entry or defensive positioning
# - Recovery situations: Regaining possession even after losing the initial faceoff draw
# - Immediate execution: Converting faceoff wins into tactical advantages (shots, exits, entries)
#
# Strategic faceoff factors Montreal considers:
# - Personnel matchups and faceoff specialist deployment in key situations
# - Zone-specific tactics (offensive setups vs defensive breakout positioning)
# - Game situation management (power plays, penalty kills, late-game scenarios)
