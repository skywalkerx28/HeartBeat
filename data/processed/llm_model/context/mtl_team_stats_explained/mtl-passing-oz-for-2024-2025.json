  "hockey_context": "Advanced Offensive Zone Passing Tactics and Scoring Chance Creation Offensive zone passing represents the most sophisticated tactical execution in hockey, requiring precise timing, spatial awareness, and coordination to create high-quality scoring opportunities against organized defensive systems. Different passing patterns serve specific tactical purposes: slot passes create net-front chances, off-the-rush passes exploit transition advantages, directional passes manipulate defensive coverage, and one-timer setups generate immediate high-danger shooting opportunities with minimal goaltender reaction time. Strategic OZ passing system factors Montreal considers:",
