  "hockey_context": "Opponent Outside Slot Strategy vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents utilize perimeter shooting and volume generation from outside slot areas when facing Montreal's defensive zone coverage and goaltending systems. Higher opponent perimeter shooting success may indicate opponents creating effective rebound opportunities, screens, and sustained pressure against Montreal's defensive coordination, while lower success suggests Montreal's defensive positioning and goaltending effectively handling perimeter pressure and limiting opponent tactical advantages through volume generation and rebound creation.
