  "description": "Measures Montreal's physical engagement and successful body contact across all three zones",
  "hockey_context": "Physical Play and Body Contact Engagement Body checks are deliberate physical contact plays where Montreal players use their body to separate opponents from the puck, disrupt plays, or establish physical dominance. Successful body checks can create turnovers, momentum shifts, and psychological advantages while wearing down opponents physically and mentally throughout the game. IMPORTANT NOTE: These body checks are ONLY counted when they result in a change of puck possession. A body check where a player simply finishes their hit without creating a turnover is NOT included in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE body checking that directly impacts puck control, not just physical contact for intimidation or momentum purposes.",
