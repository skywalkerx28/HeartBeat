  "hockey_context": "Slot Area High-Danger Shooting and Net-Front Execution The slot area represents the complete high-danger scoring zone defined as the area from the tops of the faceoff circles to the faceoff dots, extending down to the goal posts. This broader slot area includes both the elite inner slot (central area) and outer slot regions, offering excellent scoring angles and proximity to goal while facing varying levels of defensive pressure. The slot represents the primary high-danger area where teams must establish presence and convert opportunities for offensive success. Slot shooting effectiveness under pressure vs clean situations reveals tactical positioning skills, battle technique, and shot execution capabilities when facing defensive coverage. This area balances scoring opportunity quality with accessibility, making it crucial for sustained offensive pressure and goal production through strategic positioning and effective execution under defensive pressure. Strategic slot shooting factors Montreal considers:",
