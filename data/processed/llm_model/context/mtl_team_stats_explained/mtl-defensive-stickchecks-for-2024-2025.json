  "description": "Measures Montreal's skill-based defensive engagement and successful stick work across all three zones",
  "hockey_context": "Skill-Based Defensive Stick Work Stick checks are precise defensive plays where Montreal players use their stick to disrupt opponent puck handling, break up passes, or force turnovers through active stick work. These require excellent timing, positioning, and stick skills rather than physical contact. Successful stick checks demonstrate defensive hockey IQ and technical proficiency in disrupting plays without body contact. IMPORTANT NOTE: These stick checks are ONLY counted when they result in a change of puck possession. Stick checks that simply disrupt a play, slow an opponent, or break up a pass without creating a turnover are NOT included in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE stick work that directly creates possession changes for Montreal, not just defensive contact or disruption.",
