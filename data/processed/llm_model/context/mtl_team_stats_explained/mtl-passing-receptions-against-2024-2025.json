  "hockey_context": "Opponent Passing Reception vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents position themselves to receive passes and create support play when facing Montreal's defensive coverage, gap control, and tactical defensive systems. Lower opponent reception numbers may indicate Montreal's superior defensive pressure and coverage that limits opponent passing options and support positioning, while higher numbers suggest opponents successfully creating passing options and support systems despite Montreal's defensive pressure and systematic coverage interference. Strategic factors opponents consider when positioning against Montreal's defensive systems:",
