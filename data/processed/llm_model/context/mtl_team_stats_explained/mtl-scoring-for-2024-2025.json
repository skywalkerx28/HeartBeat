  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's goal scoring, shooting efficiency, and expected goals performance",
  "hockey_context": "Goal Scoring Efficiency and Shot Quality Assessment Goal scoring represents the ultimate objective in hockey, measuring how effectively Montreal converts shooting opportunities into actual goals. True shooting percentage measures pure finishing efficiency, while expected goals assess shot quality and opportunity creation. The differential between actual and expected goals reveals finishing skill, goaltender performance, and luck factors affecting goal production. These metrics determine offensive system effectiveness and directly correlate with winning games and championship success through scoring efficiency. Strategic goal scoring factors Montreal considers:",
