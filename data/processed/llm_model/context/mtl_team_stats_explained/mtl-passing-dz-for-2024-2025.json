  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's defensive zone passing execution, breakout systems, and pressure relief strategies",
  "hockey_context": "Defensive Zone Passing Systems and Breakout Execution Defensive zone passing represents the critical first phase of transitioning from defense to offense, requiring precise execution under intense forechecking pressure. Successful DZ passing enables clean breakouts, pressure relief, and transition opportunities, while failed passes lead to extended defensive zone time, continued pressure, and potential scoring chances against. Different pass types serve specific breakout purposes and require different skills, timing, and tactical awareness to execute effectively under varying levels of opponent pressure. Strategic DZ passing factors Montreal considers:",
  "common_situations": [
    "Outlet passes: Primary breakout passes to forwards for zone exit initiation and transition speed creation",
    "Stretch passes: Long-range passes up ice to create breakaway opportunities and bypass forechecking pressure",
    "D2D passes: Defenseman-to-defenseman passing for puck movement, pressure relief, and breakout angle creation",
    "Pressure relief passing: Safe passes under intense forechecking to maintain possession and reset positioning",
    "Breakout system execution: Coordinated passing patterns enabling clean zone exits and offensive transition",
    "Risk management: Balancing aggressive breakout attempts vs safe clearing under different pressure levels",
    "Forechecking pressure intensity and timing affecting pass selection (outlet vs stretch vs D2D vs clearing)",
