  "hockey_context": "Opponent Dump-In Strategic Approach vs Montreal Defense This data shows how opponents strategically employ dump-ins against Montreal's defensive system, including their decision-making process for dump-ins vs controlled entries, placement precision, and forechecking effectiveness.
