  "hockey_context": "Opponent Passing Execution vs Montreal's Defensive Pressure This data shows how effectively opponents execute their passing systems when facing Montreal's defensive pressure, gap control, and coverage systems. Lower opponent passing success rates indicate Montreal's superior defensive positioning and pressure that forces opponent turnovers and system breakdowns, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully executing their systems despite Montreal's defensive pressure and coverage intensity.
