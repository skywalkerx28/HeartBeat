  "hockey_context": "Opponent Defensive Zone Passing vs Montreal's Forechecking Systems This data shows how effectively opponents execute their defensive zone passing and breakout systems when facing Montreal's forechecking pressure, gap control, and defensive zone coverage. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior forechecking intensity and positioning that forces opponent breakout failures and extended defensive zone time, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully executing clean breakouts despite Montreal's forechecking pressure and systematic defensive zone coverage interference. Strategic factors opponents consider against Montreal's forechecking systems:",
