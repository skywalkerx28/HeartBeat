  "hockey_context": "Faceoff Possession Control and Game Flow Management Faceoffs are critical possession battles that occur after stoppages in play, directly determining which team gains initial puck control and the opportunity to execute their system. Faceoff success impacts game flow, territorial advantage, scoring opportunities, and defensive breakout efficiency. Different zones require different strategic approaches and have varying impact levels on game outcomes. Key faceoff strategic importance by zone: - Offensive Zone: Direct scoring opportunity creation through immediate puck control and setup plays - Defensive Zone: Clean breakout opportunities and pressure relief through controlled puck possession - Neutral Zone: Territorial advantage and transition control for zone entry or defensive positioning - Recovery situations: Regaining possession even after losing the initial faceoff draw - Immediate execution: Converting faceoff wins into tactical advantages (shots, exits, entries) Strategic faceoff factors Montreal considers: - Personnel matchups and faceoff specialist deployment in key situations - Zone-specific tactics (offensive setups vs defensive breakout positioning)",
