  "hockey_context": "Opponent Puck Protection vs Montreal's Defensive Pressure This data shows how effectively opponents maintain puck control and avoid turnovers when facing Montreal's defensive pressure, gap control, and coverage systems. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior defensive pressure and positioning that forces opponent possession failures and turnover creation, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully protecting pucks and maintaining possession despite Montreal's defensive pressure and systematic coverage interference through superior puck handling skills and pressure response capabilities.
