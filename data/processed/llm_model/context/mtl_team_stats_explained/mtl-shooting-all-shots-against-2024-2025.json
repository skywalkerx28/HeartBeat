  "hockey_context": "Opponent Shot Location Strategy vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents create and convert shooting opportunities from different offensive zone areas when facing Montreal's defensive coverage, gap control, and goaltending systems. Higher opponent success rates from high-danger areas indicate Montreal's defensive positioning vulnerabilities that allow quality shot creation, while lower rates suggest Montreal's superior defensive coverage and goaltending that limits opponent spatial advantages and forces lower-percentage shooting opportunities through coordinated defensive system execution.
