  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's screened shot effectiveness, tactical coordination, and goaltender obstruction by location",
  "hockey_context": "Tactical Screening and Goaltender Obstruction Strategy Screened shots represent sophisticated offensive coordination where Montreal players position themselves to obstruct the goaltender's visual sight lines while teammates shoot from various locations. Effective screening requires precise positioning, timing coordination, and physical presence to create visual obstacles without goaltender interference penalties. Screened shots significantly increase conversion rates by reducing goaltender reaction time and positioning effectiveness, while also creating higher rebound percentages for second-chance opportunities through tactical coordination. Strategic screening factors Montreal considers:",
  "common_situations": [
    "Inner slot screening: Elite net-front positioning creating visual obstacles for highest-danger area shots",
    "Slot area screening: High-danger zone coordination with screen players obstructing goaltender sight lines",
    "Point shot screening: Defensemen shooting with forwards creating screens for increased effectiveness and rebound creation",
    "Outer slot screening: Perimeter shot coordination using tactical positioning for visual obstruction and goaltender interference",
    "Screen timing: Coordinated movement and positioning ensuring visual obstruction without goaltender interference penalties",
