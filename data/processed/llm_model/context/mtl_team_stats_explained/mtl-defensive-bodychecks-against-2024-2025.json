  "description": "Shows how opponents use physical play and body contact when playing against Montreal",
  "hockey_context": "Opponent Physical Engagement vs Montreal This data shows how opponents attempt to use physical play to disrupt Montreal's system, slow down their skill players, and establish physical dominance. Lower opponent body check numbers may indicate Montreal's ability to avoid hits through speed and skill, while higher numbers suggest opponents are targeting Montreal with aggressive physical play. IMPORTANT NOTE: These body checks are ONLY counted when they result in a change of puck possession. Opponent body checks that simply deliver physical contact without creating a turnover from Montreal are NOT included in this data. These metrics measure EFFECTIVE opponent hitting that directly disrupts Montreal's puck control and possession, not just intimidation or momentum hits.",
