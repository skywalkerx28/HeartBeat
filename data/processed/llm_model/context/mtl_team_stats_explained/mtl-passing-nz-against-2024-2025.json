  "hockey_context": "Opponent Neutral Zone Passing vs Montreal's Transition Defense This data shows how effectively opponents execute neutral zone passing and transition control when facing Montreal's gap control, neutral zone coverage, and transition defensive systems. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior neutral zone defensive positioning that forces opponent transition failures and territorial disadvantage, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully controlling transitions and game flow despite Montreal's NZ coverage. Strategic factors opponents consider against Montreal's neutral zone defense:",
