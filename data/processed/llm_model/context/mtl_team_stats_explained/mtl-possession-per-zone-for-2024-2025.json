  "hockey_context": "Puck Possession and Territorial Control Fundamentals Puck possession time represents the ultimate measure of territorial control and system effectiveness, showing how long Montreal maintains puck control in each zone throughout games. Possession time directly correlates with scoring opportunities, defensive pressure relief, and strategic advantage creation. Zone-specific possession reveals system strengths, tactical emphasis, and game flow control effectiveness. Higher possession times indicate superior system execution, better decision-making, and more effective tactical coordination in territorial battles. Strategic possession factors Montreal considers:",
