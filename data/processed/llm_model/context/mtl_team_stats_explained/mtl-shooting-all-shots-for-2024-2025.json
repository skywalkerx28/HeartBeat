  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's shooting patterns, location selection, and shot quality by offensive zone area",
  "hockey_context": "Shot Location Selection and Spatial Offensive Effectiveness Shot location analysis measures how effectively Montreal creates and converts shooting opportunities from different areas of the offensive zone, revealing tactical shooting preferences, spatial awareness, and shot quality creation. High-danger areas (slot, inner slot) typically generate higher conversion rates, while perimeter shots (outside slot) offer different tactical advantages. Shot type selection (one-timers, deflections) and success rates by location show offensive system sophistication and ability to exploit defensive coverage gaps for optimal scoring opportunities. Strategic shooting factors Montreal considers:",
  "common_situations": [
    "Slot shooting: High-danger area shots with optimal scoring angles and close proximity to goal",
    "Inner slot positioning: Highest-danger area shots with maximum conversion probability and minimal goaltender reaction time",
    "Outside slot shooting: Perimeter shots offering better shooting lanes and reduced defensive coverage pressure",
    "Deflected shots: Screening and redirecting shots to create unpredictable trajectories and goaltender challenges",
    "One-timer execution: Immediate shooting with minimal goaltender positioning time from different offensive zone locations",
