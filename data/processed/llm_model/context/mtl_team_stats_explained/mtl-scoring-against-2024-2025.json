  "hockey_context": "Opponent Goal Scoring vs Montreal's Defensive Systems This data shows how effectively opponents convert shooting opportunities into goals when facing Montreal's defensive coverage, goaltending, and systematic defensive coordination. Higher opponent scoring numbers indicate Montreal's defensive system vulnerabilities that allow quality scoring opportunities and efficient goal conversion, while lower numbers suggest Montreal's superior defensive positioning and goaltending that limits opponent offensive effectiveness and prevents quality scoring chances through coordinated defensive system execution.
