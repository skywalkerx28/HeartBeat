  "hockey_context": "Opponent Goaltender Puck-Handling vs Montreal's Dump-In Strategy This data shows how effectively opponent goaltenders serve as a \"third defenseman\" when defending against Montreal's dump-in attacks. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's effective dump-in placement and forechecking pressure that disrupts opponent goalie puck-handling, while higher rates suggest opponents have strong puck-playing goalies who effectively neutralize Montreal's dump-in strategic approach. Strategic factors opponent goalies consider against Montreal:",
