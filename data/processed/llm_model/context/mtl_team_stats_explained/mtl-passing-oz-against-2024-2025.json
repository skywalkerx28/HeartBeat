  "hockey_context": "Opponent Advanced OZ Passing Tactics vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents execute sophisticated offensive zone passing patterns when facing Montreal's defensive zone coverage, gap control, and tactical defensive systems. Lower opponent success rates indicate Montreal's superior defensive positioning and pressure that disrupts opponent passing lanes and tactical execution, while higher rates suggest opponents successfully executing advanced offensive systems despite Montreal's defensive coverage. Strategic factors opponents consider against Montreal's defensive systems:",
