  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's shootout targeting precision, net area exploitation, and strategic shot placement",
  "hockey_context": "Shootout Shot Placement and Goaltender Exploitation Strategy Shootout shot placement represents the ultimate precision targeting in hockey, where Montreal players must select specific net areas to exploit goaltender positioning, reaction tendencies, and technical weaknesses. Different net areas offer varying strategic advantages: high shots exploit goaltender lateral movement limitations, low shots target positioning gaps, and 5-hole shots exploit reaction timing. Effective targeting requires goaltender analysis, technical precision, and strategic decision-making to maximize scoring probability in ultimate pressure situations. Strategic shootout targeting factors Montreal considers:",
