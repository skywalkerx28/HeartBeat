  "description": "Shows how opponents access and convert from the inner slot when facing Montreal's defensive coverage and net-front protection",
  "hockey_context": "Opponent Inner Slot Access vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents access and convert shooting opportunities from the inner slot (the central area directly in front of the goal within the broader slot zone) when facing Montreal's defensive zone coverage, net-front protection, and goaltending systems. The inner slot represents the most elite scoring area where defensive coverage is most critical for preventing high-percentage scoring opportunities. Higher opponent success rates from this highest-danger area indicate Montreal's defensive positioning vulnerabilities that allow elite scoring opportunities, while lower rates suggest Montreal's superior defensive coverage and net-front protection that limits opponent access to the most dangerous scoring location through coordinated defensive system execution and physical battle effectiveness.
