  "description": "Shows how opponents use tactical screening and goaltender obstruction when playing against Montreal's defensive systems",
  "hockey_context": "Opponent Tactical Screening vs Montreal's Defensive Coverage This data shows how effectively opponents execute tactical screening and goaltender obstruction when facing Montreal's defensive zone coverage and goaltending systems. Higher opponent screened shot success rates indicate Montreal's defensive positioning vulnerabilities that allow effective visual obstruction and coordinated offensive execution, while lower rates suggest Montreal's superior defensive coverage and screen clearing that limits opponent tactical advantages through coordinated defensive positioning and effective screen battle technique. Strategic factors affecting opponent screening against Montreal:",
