  "hockey_context": "Loose Puck Recovery Regrouping and Transition Strategy LPR (Loose Puck Recovery) regroups occur when Montreal recovers loose pucks from opponent flip dump-out situations and must decide how to transition from defense to offense. This data measures Montreal's strategic decision-making in transition: whether to attempt immediate controlled entries, regroup for better positioning, or use quick-up plays for fast breaks. Effective regrouping maximizes offensive opportunities from puck battles. Strategic LPR regroup factors Montreal considers:",
