  "hockey_context": "Neutral Zone Passing and Territorial Control Systems Neutral zone passing represents the critical transition phase between defensive and offensive systems, requiring strategic decision-making, spatial awareness, and tactical execution to control territorial advantage and game flow. Successful NZ passing enables clean zone entries, maintains possession during transitions, and creates tactical advantages, while failed passes lead to turnovers, territorial disadvantage, and opponent counterattack opportunities. The neutral zone is where games are often won or lost through effective transition control and tactical execution. Strategic NZ passing factors Montreal considers:",
