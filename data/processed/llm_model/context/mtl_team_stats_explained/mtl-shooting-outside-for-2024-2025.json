  "description": "Comprehensive analysis of Montreal's outside slot shooting effectiveness, volume creation, and perimeter offensive execution",
  "hockey_context": "Outside Slot Perimeter Shooting and Volume Creation Strategy The outside slot represents the perimeter shooting areas beyond the high-danger slot zone, extending from the faceoff circle tops and dots outward toward the blue line and offensive zone perimeter. While offering lower conversion rates than high-danger areas, outside slot shooting serves critical tactical purposes: creating rebounds for high-danger area players, establishing offensive zone presence, generating shot volume for momentum, and forcing goaltenders to make saves that can create second-chance opportunities through strategic positioning. Strategic outside slot factors Montreal considers:",
