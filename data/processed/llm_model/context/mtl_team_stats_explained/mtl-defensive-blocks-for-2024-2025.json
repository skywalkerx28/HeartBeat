  "description": "Measures Montreal's defensive lane coverage, shot blocking, and pass disruption across all three zones",
  "hockey_context": "Defensive Lane Coverage and Shot/Pass Disruption Shot and pass blocking represents Montreal's ability to get into shooting and passing lanes to disrupt opponent offensive plays through positioning, anticipation, and physical sacrifice. These plays require excellent reading of the game, proper positioning, and willingness to put body parts in front of pucks. Successful blocks prevent scoring chances and passing plays from developing.",
