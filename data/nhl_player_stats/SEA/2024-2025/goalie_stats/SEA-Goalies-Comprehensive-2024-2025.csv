# Seattle Kraken Goalies Comprehensive Analytics - Team-Internal Percentiles + Basic Stats + Zone Metrics
# Combines advanced analytics (40 metrics for 5/8 players) with traditional stats (GP, W, L, GAA, SA, SV, SV%) and zone analytics (28 additional metrics for 3/8 players)
# Percentiles represent rankings within the SEA goalie group (not league-wide) - only available for players with sufficient playing time
# Example: 0.85 = 85th percentile among SEA goalies with advanced data = better than 85% of teammates with similar playing time
# Note: Only 5/8 goalies have advanced analytics, 3/8 have zone data (backup goalies and prospects get basic stats only)
