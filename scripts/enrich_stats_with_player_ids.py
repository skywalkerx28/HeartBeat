Enrich League Player Stats with Player IDs and Birth Dates

This script adds player ID and date of birth columns to all unified player stats files
by matching player names with the unified_roster_historical.json file.

INPUT:
- data/processed/rosters/unified_roster_historical.json (lookup source)
- data/processed/league_player_stats/{season}/unified_player_stats_{season}.csv

OUTPUT:
- Updates each CSV with two new columns: 'Player ID' and 'Date of Birth'
