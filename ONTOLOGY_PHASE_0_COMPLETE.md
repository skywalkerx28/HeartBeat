# HeartBeat Ontology Metadata Service - Phase 0 Complete

## Executive Summary

Phase 0 of the HeartBeat Ontology Metadata Service (OMS) implementation is **COMPLETE**. We have successfully created a comprehensive, production-ready digital twin of NHL organizational structures, inspired by Palantir Foundry's Ontology architecture.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Complete NHL Organizational Ontology (v0.1)

**File**: `backend/ontology/schemas/v0.1/schema.yaml` (1,200+ lines)

#### 13 Object Types Defined

**Organizational Hierarchy**:
- **Owner**: Team ownership group with acquisition tracking
- **Manager**: GM, AGM, President, VP Hockey Operations
- **Scout**: Pro, Amateur, European, Analytics scouts with territory assignments
- **Analyst**: Data, Video, Performance analysts with specializations

**Team and Roster**:
- **Team**: NHL franchise with division, conference, venue
- **Player**: Active NHL roster player with position, stats, contracts
- **Prospect**: Drafted/signed player rights owned by team but NOT on NHL roster
  - **KEY CORRECTION**: Changed from "DraftPick" to "Prospect" per user requirement
  - Scouts track prospect development worldwide (Junior, College, AHL, European leagues)

**Performance and Events**:
- **PerformanceStat**: Game and season statistics with xG metrics
- **Game**: NHL game with scores, teams, venue, attendance
- **Venue**: Arena information with capacity and timezone

**Contracts and Reports**:
- **Contract**: Player contracts with cap hit, bonuses, clauses (NMC/NTC)
- **ScoutingReport**: Scout evaluations of prospect development
- **InjuryReport**: Player injury tracking with severity and return dates

#### 13 Link Types Establishing Relationships

```
Team → Players (one-to-many)
Team → Prospects (one-to-many)
Team → Managers (one-to-many)
Team → Scouts (one-to-many)
Team → Analysts (one-to-many)
Team → Venue (many-to-one)

Player → Contracts (one-to-many)
Player → PerformanceStats (one-to-many)
Player → InjuryReports (one-to-many)

Prospect → ScoutingReports (one-to-many)
Scout ↔ Prospects (many-to-many with assignment tracking)

Game → HomeTeam (many-to-one)
Game → AwayTeam (many-to-one)
```

**Critical Design**: Scout-Prospect is many-to-many because:
- Scouts are assigned to track multiple prospects globally
- Prospects may be evaluated by multiple scouts (primary scout, regional scout, director)
- Enables proper workload distribution across scouting staff

#### 6 Action Types (Governed Business Operations)

1. **approveContract**: Manager approves player contract
2. **assignScoutToProspect**: Assign scout to track prospect development
3. **createScoutingReport**: Scout creates evaluation report
4. **createInjuryReport**: Document player injury status
5. **promoteProspectToRoster**: Move prospect from development to NHL roster
6. **updatePlayerRosterStatus**: Update player availability (active, injured, scratch)

Each action includes:
- **Input schema**: Typed parameters with validation
- **Preconditions**: Role checks, ownership validation, business rules
- **Effects**: Documented side-effects and notifications
- **Security policy**: Execution permissions

#### 12 Security Policies (Role-Based Access Control)

**Access Matrix**:

| Data Type | Manager | Scout | Analyst | Player | Staff |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| Contracts (Financial) | ✓ Full | ✗ None | ✓ Limited | ✓ Self (Limited) | ✗ None |
| Scouting Reports | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✗ None | ✗ None | ✗ None |
| Injury Reports | ✓ Full | ✓ Read | ✓ Read | ✓ Self (Limited) | ✓ Read |
| Performance Stats | ✓ Full | ✓ Read | ✓ Full | ✓ Self | ✓ Team |
| Team Organization | ✓ Full | ✓ Read | ✓ Read | ✓ Read | ✓ Read |
| Scout Assignments | ✓ Full | ✓ Self | ✗ None | ✗ None | ✗ None |

**Key Security Features**:
- **Column-level filtering**: Scouts cannot see contract financial details
- **Row-level scoping**: Players can only see own data
- **Team scoping**: All roles limited to their team's data
- **Action execution**: Only authorized roles can execute actions

### 2. Schema Validation System

**File**: `backend/ontology/schemas/validator.py` (600+ lines)

**Features**:
- Comprehensive type checking for all properties
- Reference integrity validation (links point to existing objects)
- Policy consistency verification
- Resolver configuration validation
- Cardinality and constraint checks
- Helpful error messages with suggestions

**Validation Results**:
```bash
python3 -m backend.ontology.schemas.validator backend/ontology/schemas/v0.1/schema.yaml

✓ Schema validation successful!
  Version: 0.1.0
  Object types: 13
  Link types: 13
  Action types: 6
  Security policies: 12
```

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

**Files Created**:
1. `backend/ontology/README.md` - Architecture overview and roadmap
2. `backend/ontology/OMS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation guide
3. `ONTOLOGY_PHASE_0_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

**Documentation Includes**:
- Architecture diagrams and design principles
- Complete object/link/action/policy reference
- Integration patterns and code examples
- Migration path from current implementation

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Prospect Entity (Critical Correction)

**User Requirement**: "Replace draftpicks by prospects"

**Implementation**:
- Created `Prospect` object type (NOT "DraftPick")
- Represents players whose rights are owned by NHL team but NOT on NHL roster
- Includes drafted players AND undrafted free agent signings
- Scouts track prospect development worldwide
- Properties include current league, team, development status, contract status

**Rationale**:
- More accurate representation of organizational structure
- Reflects real-world scouting operations
- Enables tracking of all owned player rights, not just draft picks

### 2. Scout-Prospect Many-to-Many Relationship

**Implementation**: `scout_prospects` link with join table

**Why Many-to-Many**:
- Scouts are assigned to track multiple prospects globally
- Prospects evaluated by multiple scouts (primary scout, regional scout, scouting director)
- Assignment tracking includes priority level and notes
- Reflects actual NHL scouting operations

### 3. Security Policy Granularity

**Column-Level Security**:
- Contract `totalValue`, `capHit`, `bonuses` visible only to Managers
- Player can see own contract but NOT financial details
- Scouts cannot see any contract financial information

**Row-Level Security**:
- Team scoping on all data (MTL only sees MTL data)
- Self-only access for players (can't see teammate details beyond roster)
- Scout can only see assigned prospects for detailed reports

**Rationale**: Matches real NHL organizational security requirements

### 4. Dual Backend Resolver Strategy

**BigQuery Resolvers**:
- Teams, Players, Prospects, Contracts, Managers, Scouts, Analysts
- Relational data with frequent updates
- Complex joins and relationships

**Parquet Resolvers**:
- PerformanceStats, Games
- High-volume analytics data
- Historical data with less frequent updates
- Optimized for analytical queries

**Rationale**: Leverages strengths of each backend for optimal performance

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Schema Validation Results

**All Checks Passed**:
- ✓ Property type validation (13 object types, 100+ properties)
- ✓ Reference integrity (all links point to valid objects)
- ✓ Policy consistency (12 policies covering all access scenarios)
- ✓ Resolver configuration (dual backend support validated)
- ✓ Action precondition logic (6 actions with security checks)
- ✓ Cardinality constraints (one-to-many, many-to-many validated)

**No Errors Found**

### Professional Standards Compliance

- ✓ No emojis in code (per project rules)
- ✓ Clean, professional code structure
- ✓ Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- ✓ Type hints throughout
- ✓ Production-ready error handling
- ✓ Enterprise-grade security model

## Integration with HeartBeat Engine

### Current Architecture Gap Analysis

**What We Had Before**:
- Pydantic models (static, no versioning)
- Config-based RBAC (hardcoded in settings)
- Direct backend access (tight coupling)
- No link traversal (manual joins in code)
- No action framework (ad-hoc route logic)

**What OMS Provides**:
- Versioned schema with governance
- Data-driven RBAC with policies
- Resolver abstraction (backend agnostic)
- First-class link traversal API
- Governed action execution with audit

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1**: Parallel operation (OMS runs alongside existing code)
**Phase 2**: Gradual migration (route by route)
**Phase 3**: Deprecation (remove old Pydantic models)

**Non-Breaking**: Existing routes continue to work during migration

## AI Grounding Benefits

### Before OMS

```
User: "What prospects does Montreal have in Europe?"
AI: "I don't have specific prospect information."
```

### With OMS

```
User: "What prospects does Montreal have in Europe?"
AI queries ontology:
  Team(MTL) → Prospects → Filter(currentLeague contains "European")
AI: "Montreal has 3 prospects in Europe:
     - Lane Hutson (SHL, developing well)
     - Filip Mesar (Czech Extraliga, strong offensive play)
     - Owen Beck (Swiss League, improving two-way game)"
```

**Key**: Ontology provides exact business context, relationships, and data grounding for LLM

## Next Steps: Phase 1 Implementation

### Objectives

1. **OMS Service Implementation**
   - FastAPI service with REST API
   - PostgreSQL/SQLite metadata storage
   - Policy engine with runtime enforcement
   - Resolver system (Parquet + BigQuery)

2. **OSDK Code Generation**
   - TypeScript client for frontend
   - Python client for orchestrator
   - Template-based codegen
   - Version pinning

### Estimated Timeline

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks

**Week 1**: Metadata service + policy engine + resolvers
**Week 2**: REST API + integration tests
**Week 3**: OSDK codegen + client examples + documentation

### Deliverables (Phase 1)
