## Overview

Full NHL market analytics infrastructure has been implemented with BigQuery integration, Parquet fallback, REST APIs, orchestrator tools, and frontend integration. The system provides comprehensive contract, cap, trade, and market analysis capabilities.

---

## Architecture

### Multi-Layer Data Strategy

**Layer 1: Structured Analytics** (BigQuery + GCS Parquet)
- Contract/cap/trade data stored as Parquet in GCS data lake
- BigQuery external tables for historical queries
- BigQuery native tables for current season high-frequency data
- Used for: Numerical queries, structured data retrieval, aggregations

**Layer 2: Semantic Context** (Pinecone RAG - `market_context` namespace)
- CBA rules and interpretations
- Contract efficiency frameworks
- Historical market patterns
- Trade valuation guidelines
- Used for: Explanations, interpretations, strategic knowledge

**Layer 3: Real-time Events** (NHL API)
- Live trade announcements
- Cap updates
- Breaking news

---

## Implemented Components

### 1. Data Schemas (`scripts/market_data/schemas.py`)

Parquet schemas defined for:
- **Player Contracts**: Cap hits, terms, NMC/NTC, contract types
- **Contract Performance Index**: Efficiency metrics, market value, surplus value
- **Team Cap Management**: Cap space, LTIR, projections
- **Trade History**: Player movements, draft picks, cap implications
- **Market Comparables**: Similar contracts with similarity scores
- **League Market Summary**: Position-based market statistics

### 2. BigQuery Infrastructure

**Setup Scripts**:
- `scripts/market_data/setup_bigquery.py`: GCS bucket and BigQuery dataset creation
- `scripts/market_data/bigquery_setup.sql`: External/native table DDL

**Tables Created**:
- External tables pointing to GCS Parquet (cost-effective)
- Native partitioned tables for current season (performance)
- Views for common queries (active_contracts, team_cap_summary, efficiency_leaders)

**Optimization**:
- Partitioning by sync_date/trade_date
- Clustering by team_abbrev, position, contract_status
- 90-day Nearline, 1-year Coldline lifecycle rules

### 3. Market Data Client (`orchestrator/tools/market_data_client.py`)

Production-grade client with:
- BigQuery-first architecture
- Parquet fallback for resilience
- In-memory caching (10-min TTL)
- Comprehensive error handling

**Methods**:
- `get_player_contract()`: Contract details by player ID or name
- `get_team_cap_summary()`: Cap space, commitments, projections
- `get_contract_comparables()`: Similar contracts with scores
- `get_league_market_summary()`: League-wide position statistics
- `get_recent_trades()`: Recent trades with cap implications
- `calculate_contract_efficiency()`: Performance vs value metrics

### 4. Market Metrics (`orchestrator/tools/market_metrics.py`)

**Contract Efficiency Index**:
- Position-weighted components (forwards vs defense vs goalies)
- Points/60, xG/60, defensive metrics
- Age curve adjustment
- Term penalty calculation
- Market value estimation

**Comparable Scoring**:
- Age proximity (25%)
- Production similarity (35%)
- Position match (15%)
- Contract era (10%)
- Team/market context (15%)

**Surplus Value**:
- Annual surplus = market value - cap hit
- Total surplus = annual × years remaining
- Classification: bargain, fair, overpaid

### 5. REST API Endpoints (`backend/api/routes/market.py`)

**Contract Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/market/contracts/player/{player_id}` - Player contract details
- `GET /api/v1/market/contracts/player/name/{name}` - Contract by name
- `GET /api/v1/market/contracts/team/{team}` - All team contracts

**Cap Analysis**:
- `GET /api/v1/market/cap/team/{team}` - Cap summary with projections

**Market Intelligence**:
- `GET /api/v1/market/efficiency` - Contract efficiency rankings
- `GET /api/v1/market/comparables/{player_id}` - Comparable contracts
- `GET /api/v1/market/trades` - Recent trades with cap impact

### 8. Sample Data Generator (`scripts/market_data/generate_sample_market_data.py`)

Generates realistic sample data for development:
- 20-25 contracts per team (32 teams)
- Position-based contract ranges
- Age-appropriate contract types (ELC, RFA, UFA)
- Realistic cap hits and terms
- NMC/NTC for high-paid veterans
- Performance indices and efficiency metrics
- Team cap calculations
- Trade history with cap implications

## Data Flow

### Contract Query Example

**User asks**: "What's Nick Suzuki's contract efficiency?"

**STANLEY's process**:
1. Calls `get_player_contract(player_name="Nick Suzuki")`
2. MarketDataClient queries BigQuery native table
3. Returns: Cap hit $7.875M, 6 years remaining, efficiency 1.34, status: overperforming
4. Calls `get_league_market_overview(position="C")` for context
5. Returns: Average center cap hit $4.2M, Suzuki in 85th percentile
6. Synthesizes: "Suzuki's contract is excellent value - efficiency 1.34 means he's outperforming his cap hit. At $7.875M, he's in the top 15% of centers league-wide, but delivering top-5 production."

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Setup BigQuery Infrastructure

```bash
# Create GCS bucket and BigQuery dataset
python scripts/market_data/setup_bigquery.py

# Run DDL to create tables
bq query < scripts/market_data/bigquery_setup.sql
```

### 2. Generate Sample Data

```bash
# Generate sample Parquet files
python scripts/market_data/generate_sample_market_data.py
```

### 3. Upload to GCS

```python
from scripts.market_data.setup_bigquery import MarketInfrastructureSetup

setup = MarketInfrastructureSetup()
await setup.upload_sample_parquet(
    local_path=Path("data/processed/market/players_contracts_2025_2026.parquet"),
    gcs_folder="contracts/"
)
```

### 4. Load to BigQuery

BigQuery external tables automatically read from GCS. For native tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO `heartbeat-474020.market.players_contracts`
SELECT * FROM `heartbeat-474020.market.players_contracts_external`
WHERE season IN ('2024-2025', '2025-2026');
```

### 5. Test APIs

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market/health

# Test contract lookup
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market/contracts/player/name/Nick%20Suzuki

# Test cap summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market/cap/team/MTL
```

### 6. Test Orchestrator Tools

```python
from orchestrator.agents.qwen3_best_practices_orchestrator import Qwen3BestPracticesOrchestrator

orchestrator = Qwen3BestPracticesOrchestrator()
result = await orchestrator._execute_tool(
    "get_player_contract",
    {"player_name": "Nick Suzuki"},
    state
)
```

The framework is complete and ready. You will populate the database with real contract data:

### Data Sources

1. **Public Sources**:
   - CapFriendly archives (historical data)
   - Team websites (official announcements)
   - NHLPA public salary data
   - NHL.com transaction logs

2. **Data to Collect**:
   - Player contracts (cap hit, term, clauses)
   - Team cap space and LTIR
   - Trade history with cap implications
   - Contract signings and extensions

3. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - CSV/Excel → Parquet conversion
   - Schema validation using `scripts/market_data/schemas.py`
   - Upload to GCS
   - Load to BigQuery

4. **Automation** (Optional):
   - Daily sync script for new contracts
   - Trade monitoring from NHL API
   - Cap space recalculation

### Template Structure

Use `scripts/market_data/templates/` for manual entry:
- `player_contracts_template.csv`
- `trade_history_template.csv`
- Import scripts to convert to Parquet

## Integration Points

### Pinecone (Future)

Add CBA and market context to Pinecone `market_context` namespace:
- Salary retention rules
- Contract structure explanations
- Trade valuation frameworks
